TH@ $TREET$ was inspired by many things:

The actual name:
- @ to refer to people and location
- $ to refer to business

Both characters are some of my personal favourite characters because they are:
- almost the most used characters on a linux terminal.
- many bash/sh prompts have these on their default prompt (PS1 - Prompt String 1).
